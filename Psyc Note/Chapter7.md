# Learning
- involves the acquisition, from experience, of new knowledge, skills, or responses that results in a relatively permanent change in the state of the learner

- based on experience
- produces changes in the organism
- changes are relatively permanent

## Habituation
- a general process in which repeated or prolonged exposure to a stimulus results in a gradual reduction in responding

## Sensitization
- when presentation of a stimulus leads to an increased response to a later stimulus

# Classical Conditioning
- occurs when a neutral stimulus produces a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally produces a response

- unconditioned stimulus: something that reliably produces a naturally occurring reaction in an organism

- unconditioned response: a reflex reaction that is reliably produced by an unconditioned stimulus

- Acquisition: the phase of classical conditioning when the CS and US are presented together

- Conditioned Stimulus: a previously neutral stimulus that produces a reliable response in an organism after being paired with a US

- Conditioned Response: a reaction that resembles an unconditioned response but is produced by a conditioned stimulus

- Second-order Conditioning: a type of learning where a CS is paired with a stimulus that became associated the the US in an earlier procedure

- Extinction: the gradual elimination of a learned response that occurs when the CS is repeatedly presented without the US

- Spontaneous Recovery: the tendency of a learned behavior to recover from extinction after a rest period

## Biological Preparedness
- a propensity for learning particular kinds of associations over others

# Operant Conditioning
- Reinforcements from the environment 
- a type of learning in which the consequences of an organism's behavior determine whether it will repeat that behavior in the future

## Law of effect
- behavior that are followed by a satisfying state of affairs tend to be repeated, and those that produce an unpleasant stat of affairs are less likely to be repeated

## Operant Behavior
- behavior that an organism performs that has some impact on the environment

### Reinforcer
- any stimulus or event that increases the likelihood of the behavior that led to it

### Punisher
- any stimulus or event that  decreases the likelihood of the behavior that led to it

- Positive Reinforcement: a stimulus is presented that increases the likelihood of a behavior
- Negative Reinforcement: a stimulus is removed that increases the likelihood of a behavior
- Positive Punishment: a stimulus is administered that reduces the likelihood of a behavior
- Negative Punishment: a stimulus is removed that decreases the likelihood of a behavior

### Interval Schedules 
- Fixed-Interval Schedule: reinforcers are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response ins made

- Variable-interval schedule: a behavior is reinforced on the bases of an average time that has expired since the last reinforcement

### Ratio Schedule
- Fixed-Ratio Schedule: reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made
    - the special case where a reinforcement is presented after each response is called continuous reinforcement

- Variable Fixed-Ratio Schedule: reinforcement is delivered based on a particular average number of responses

### Intermittent Reinforcement
- only some of the responses made are followed by reinforcement

### Intermittent Reinforcement Effect
- the fact that operant behavior that are maintained under intermittent reinforcement schedules resist extinction better than those maintained under continuous reinforcement

### Shaping
- learning that results from the reinforcement of successive steps to a final desired behavior

### Latent Learning
- something is learned but it is not manifested as a behavioral change until sometime in the future

### Cognitive Map
- a mental representation of the physical features of the environment
