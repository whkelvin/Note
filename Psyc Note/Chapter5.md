# Consciousness

## Phenomenology
- how things seem to the conscious person

## Problem of other minds
- the fundamental difficulty we have in perceiving the consciousness of others
- capacity for experience : feelings
- capacity for agency : ability to self-control, planning, memory, or thought
- mind is not observable

## The mind-body problem 
- the issue of how the mind is related to the brain and body

## 4 Basic properties of consciousness
1. Intentionality: the quality of being directed toward an object

2. Unity: resistance to division, or the ability to integrate information from all of the body's senses into one coherent whole

3. Selectivity: the ability to include some object but not others
* Dichotic Listening: people wearing headphones hear different messages in each ear (Filters) 
* Cocktail-party Phenomenon: people tune in one message even while they filter out others nearby

4. Transience: the tendency to change

## Level of Consciousness
- Minimal Consciousness: a low level kind of sensory awareness and responsiveness that occurs when the mind inputs sensations and may output behavior
- Full Consciousness: you know and are able to report your mental state
- Self Consciousness: the person's attention is drawn to the self as an object

## Default Network
- activation of brain area when people are not doing anything

## Mental Control
- the attempt to change conscious states of mind
- Thought Suppression: the conscious avoidance of a thought
- Rebound Effect Of Thought Suppression: the tendency of a thought to return to consciousness with greater frequency following suppression

## Ironic Processes of Mental Control
- ironic error occur because the mental process that monitors errors can itself produce them

## Freudian Unconscious
- Dynamic Unconscious: active system encompassing a lifetime of hidden memories , the person's deepest instincts and desires, and the person's inner struggle to control these forces
-Repression: a mental process that removes unacceptable thoughts and memories from consciousness and keeps them in the unconscious

## Cognitive Unconscious
- all the mental processes that give rise to a person's thoughts, choices, emotions, and behavior even though they are not experienced by the person

## Dual-Process Theories
- we have two different systems in our brains for processing; and two different systems in our brains for processing information
1. fast, automatic, unconscious
2. slow, effortful and conscious

## Subliminal Perception
- when thought or behavior is influenced by stimuli that a person cannot consciously report perceiving


 # Sleep
 ## Altered state o Consciousness
 - a form of experience that departs significantly from the normal subjective experience of the world and the mind

 # Sleep Cycle
 ## Circadian Rhythm 
 - a naturally occurring 24-hours cycle 
 ## 5 Stages of Sleep
  Waking: (low frequency alpha wave and high frequency beta wave)
 1. First stage: theta wave (lower frequency than alpha wave)
 2. Second stage: sleep spindle(short burst of activity) and k-complex
 3, 4. Third and Fourth: delta wave(slow wave sleep)
 4. Rem Sleep: a stage of sleep characterized by rapid eye movement and high level of brain activity 

 ## Electrooculography(EOG)
 - an instrument that measures eye movements 

 ## Sleep Disorder
 - Insomnia: difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep
 - Sleep Apnea: a disorder in which the person stops breathing for brief periods while asleep
 - Somnambulism (sleep walking): a person arises and walks around while asleep

 - Night Terrors:
 abrupt awakenings with panic and intense emotional arousal

 ## Dream
 - Manifest Content: a dream's apparent topic or superficial meaning
 - Latent Content: a dream's true underlying meaning

 ## Activation - Synthesis Model
 - dreams occurs when brain is trying to make sense of random neural activity in the brain during sleep

 # Drugs
 - Psychoactive Drugs: chemicals than influence consciousness or behavior by altering the brain's chemical message system

## Addiction
1. Drug Tolerance: the tendency for larger drug doses to be required over time to achieve the same effect
2. Physical Dependence: convulsions, pain, hallucinations...
3. Psychological Dependence: emotional need
