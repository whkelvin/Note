# Memory
- the ability to store and retrieve information 

## 3 key functions of memory
1. encoding: the process of transforming what we perceive, think, or feel into an enduring memory
2. storage: the process of maintaining information in memory over time
3. Retrieval: the process of bringing to mind information that has been previously encode and stored

## Encoding
### Semantic encoding
- the process of relating new information in a meaningful way to knowledge that is already stored in memory

### Visual Imagery Encoding
- the process of storing new information by converting it into mental pictures

### Organizational Encoding 
- the process of categorizing information according to the relationship among a series of items

### Encoding of Survival-Related Information


## Storage
### Sensory Memory
- a type of storage that holds sensory information for a few seconds or less
#### Iconic Memory
- a fast-decaying store of visual information
#### Echoic Memory
- a fast-decaying store of auditory information 

### Short-Term Memory
- holds non sensory information for more than a few seconds but less than a minute

#### Ways to Strengthen Short-Term Memory
- Rehearsal: the process of keeping information in short-term memory by mentally repeating it.
    * Serial Position Effect:
 the first few and last few items in a series are more likely to be recalled than the items in the middle
      * Primary Effect: recall of first few items 
      * Recency Effect: recall of last few items

- Chunking: combining small pieces of information into larger cluster or chunks that are more easily held in short-term memory

### Working Memory
- active maintenance of information in short-term storage 
- include two subsystems that store and manipulate information: visual image(spatial sketchpad) and verbal information(phonological loop)
- episodic buffer integrates information from the subsystems into multidimension code
- central executive coordinates the subsystems and the episodic buffer

### Long Term Memory
- a type of storage that holds information for hours, days, weeks, or years

#### Anterograde Amnesia
- the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store

#### Retrograde Amnesia 
- the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an injury or surgery

#### Consolidation Stabilizes Memories
- the process by which memories become stable in the brain

#### Reconsolidation
- memories can become vulnerable to disruption when they are recalled, thus requiring them to be consolidated again

#### Long Term Potentiation
- a process whereby communication across the synapse between neurons strengthens the connection, making further communication easier
