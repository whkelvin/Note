# Memory
- the ability to store and retrieve information 

## 3 key functions of memory
1. encoding: the process of transforming what we perceive, think, or feel into an enduring memory
2. storage: the process of maintaining information in memory over time
3. Retrieval: the process of bringing to mind information that has been previously encode and stored

## Encoding
### Semantic encoding
- the process of relating new information in a meaningful way to knowledge that is already stored in memory

### Visual Imagery Encoding
- the process of storing new information by converting it into mental pictures

### Organizational Encoding 
- the process of categorizing information according to the relationship among a series of items

### Encoding of Survival-Related Information


## Storage
### Sensory Memory
- a type of storage that holds sensory information for a few seconds or less
#### Iconic Memory
- a fast-decaying store of visual information
#### Echoic Memory
- a fast-decaying store of auditory information 

### Short-Term Memory
- holds non sensory information for more than a few seconds but less than a minute

#### Ways to Strengthen Short-Term Memory
- Rehearsal: the process of keeping information in short-term memory by mentally repeating it.
    * Serial Position Effect:
 the first few and last few items in a series are more likely to be recalled than the items in the middle
      * Primary Effect: recall of first few items 
      * Recency Effect: recall of last few items

- Chunking: combining small pieces of information into larger cluster or chunks that are more easily held in short-term memory

### Working Memory
- active maintenance of information in short-term storage 
- include two subsystems that store and manipulate information: visual image(spatial sketchpad) and verbal information(phonological loop)
- episodic buffer integrates information from the subsystems into multi-dimension code
- central executive coordinates the subsystems and the episodic buffer

### Long Term Memory
- a type of storage that holds information for hours, days, weeks, or years

#### Anterograde Amnesia
- the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store

#### Retrograde Amnesia 
- the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an injury or surgery

#### Consolidation Stabilizes Memories
- the process by which memories become stable in the brain

#### Reconsolidating
- memories can become vulnerable to disruption when they are recalled, thus requiring them to be consolidated again

#### Long Term Potentiation
- a process whereby communication across the synapse between neurons strengthens the connection, making further communication easier

## Retrieval 
- Retrieval Cue: external information that is associated with stored information and helps bring it to mind 

## Encoding Specificity Principle (external context provides cues)
- a retrieval cue can serve as an effective reminder that when it helps recreate the specific way in which information was initially encoded

## State Dependent Retrieval (internal states provide cues)
- the process whereby information tends to be better recalled when the person is in the same state during encoding and retrieval.

## Transfer-Appropriate Processing
- the idea that memory is likely to transfer from one situation to another when the encoding and retrieval contexts of the situations match

## Retrieval Induced Forgetting
= a process by which retrieving an item from long-term memory impairs subsequent recall of related items 

# Forms of Long Term Memory
- Explicit Memory: happens when people consciously or intentionally retrieve past experience

- Implicit Memory: past experiences influence later behavior and performance even without an effort to remember them or an awareness of the recollection

## Implicit Memory
- Procedural Memory: the gradual acquisition of skills as a result of practice or knowing how to do things

- Priming: an enhanced ability of think of a stimulus, such as a word or object, as a result of a recent exposure to the stimulus

- Both priming and procedural memory do not need hippocampus

### 2 Forms of Priming
- Perceptual Priming: reflects implicit memory for the sensory features of an item

- Conceptual Priming: reflects implicit memory for the meaning of a word and how you would use an object

### Explicit Memory 
- Semantic Memory: a network o associated facts and concepts that make up our general knowledge of the world
- Episodic Memory: a collection of past personal experiences that occurred at a particular time and place (mental time travel)

# Memory Failures
1. Transience: forgetting what occurs with the passage of time
    - Retroactive Interference: situations in which later learning impairs memory for information acquired earlier
    - Proactive Interference: situation in which earlier learning impairs memory for information acquired later

2. AbsentMindedness
    - a lapse in attention that results in memory failure
    - Prospective Memory: remembering to do things in the future (eg do not remember to remember)

3. Blocking
    - a failure to retrieve information that is available in memory even though you are trying to reproduce it (tip-of-tongue experience)

4. Memory Misattribution 
    - assigning a recollection or an idea to the wrong source (eyewitness memory failure)
    - Source Memory: recall of when, where and how information was acquired
    - False Recognition: a feeling of familiarity about something that hasn't been encountered before (deja vu)

5. Suggestibility
    - the tendency to incorporate misleading information from external sources into personal recollections

6. Bias 
    - the distorting influences of present knowledge, beliefs, and feelings on recollection of previous experiences

    - Consistency Bias: the bias to reconstruct the past to fit the present
    - Change Bias: the tendency to exaggerate differences between what we feel or believe now and what we felt or believed in the past
    - Egocentric Bias: the tendency to exaggerate the change between present and past in order to make ourselves look good in retrospect

7. Persistence
    - the intrusive recollection of events that we wish we could forget
    - Flashbulb memories: detailed recollections of when and where we heard about shocking events
