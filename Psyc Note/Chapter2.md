# 2.1 
# Dogmatism
 - peopleâ€™s tendency to cling to assumptions.

# Scientific Method
 * finding facts by using empirical evidence
 * Theory 
   - a hypothetical explanation of a natural phenomenon
   - testable
 * Hypothesis
   - a falsifiable prediction made from a theory
   - must come in pair,H0
   (null hypothesis), H1(alternate hypothesis)
   - Example
     - Does yoga improve the ability to concentrate?

# Empirical Method 
- a set of rules and techniques for observation
Operational definition - which is a description of a property in concrete measurable terms.

# Instrument
 - anything that can detect the condition to which an operational definition refers.

# Validity
 - the extent to which a concrete event defines a property

# Reliability
 - the tendency for an instrument to produce the same measurement whenever it is used to measure the same thing

# Demand Characteristics
* are those aspects of an observational setting that cause people to behave as they think someone else wants or expect

#Naturalistic Observation
* is a technique for gathering scientific information by unobtrusively observing people in their natural environments.
## Ways to achieve this:
* privacy & control
* unawareness

# Observer Bias
* seeing what is expected (expectation can influence observation) (expectation can influence reality)

### Ways to prevent this...
* Double-blind - the truth is hidden from both observer and object being observed.

# Confirmation Bias
* the tendency to look for evidences that support one's hypothesis

# Statistic 
  ## Frequency Distribution
  - a graphic representation of measurements arranged by the number of times each measurement was made

* Mode - the value that appears most frequently
* mean - the overall average
* Median - the value in the middle
* Range - the max measured value - the min measured value
* Standard Deviation - the average difference between a measured data set and its mean


## 9/24 In Class-----------
## Research Strategies
- 5 different strategies are commonly used for hypothesis testing 
### 1. Case Study
   * detailed study of one individual, group, device, event, etc.
   * Advantage: gain ideas, insight
   * Limitation: useless for testing theories, study may not be replicable
### 2. Naturalistic Observation Study  
   * observing/recording behavior in naturally occurring situations, without manipulating/controlling the situation
   * Advantage: 
      * high in ecological validity (shows behavior in the wild)
      * may spark new research
      * may complement experimental/lab research
   * Limitation:
      * used to describe behavior, not for explaining
      * often difficult to obtain a complete description of all variable that influence behavior
   * **Ecological Validity** (*EcoV*): A study has high EcoV if its methods, materials and setting closely approximate the real-world in which a target behavior is being examined.
   * **External Validity** (*ExtV*): A study has high ExtV if its finding generalize to circumstances beyond the research setting
### 3. Survey/Questionnaire Study
   * a method of ascertaining the self-reported attitudes, emotions, preferences, behaviors, habits, etc. of individuals or of groups of individuals
   * Advantage: 
      * easy, cheap, quick to obtain large amount of data
      * can be used to learn about any type of issue/question
      * may be high in ecological validity
   * Limitations:
      * wording of questions/items and ordering of questions/items affects results
      * Respondents may not be honest, may 'fake positive'
      * very difficult to obtain a representative sample
### 4. Correlational Study   
   * a systematic assessment of the relationship between two or more variables
   * may involve an examination of existing records   
   * learn about relationship between two or more variables, and make predications from one the the other
   * Advantage:
      easy cheap quick to obtain large amount of data
      can be used address nearly any events
      high in eco validity
   * Limitation : cannot provide info about cause effect links

  #### Method:
   1. Find variables (properties whose values can vary across individuals or over time)
   2. Make series of measurement
   3. Find pattern of covariation
      - Positive Correlation - more is more or less is less
      - Negative Correlation - less is more of more is less
  #### Third Variable Problem
   - two variable are correlated only because each is causally related to a third variable   
        
  ##### Ways to prevent this:
  - Matched Samples - participants have an identical variable
  - Matched Pairs - participants share a third variable on average
  #### Correlation Coefficient(r)
  if r = 1 => perfect positive correlation
  if r == 0 => no correlation
  if r = -1 => perfect negative correlation

### 5. Experimental Study
  - Manipulation of variable to see how one change(independent variable) as a result of another( dependent variable )
  - control group vs experimental group

  #### Self Selection 
  - a problem when anything about a participant determines whether he or she will be included in the experimental group
  #### Random Assignment 
  - let change decide who will be in control/experiment group
