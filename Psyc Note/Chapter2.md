# 2.1 
# Dogmatism
 - peopleâ€™s tendency to cling to assumptions.

# Scientific Method
 * finding facts by using empirical evidence
 * Theory 
   - a hypothetical explanation of a natural phenomenon
   - testable
 * Hypothesis
   - a falsifiable prediction made from a theory
   - must come in pair,H0
   (null hypothesis), H1(alternate hypothesis)
   - Example
     - Does yoga improve the ability to concentrate?

# Empirical Method 
- a set of rules and techniques for observation
Operational definition - which is a description of a property in concrete measurable terms.

# Instrument
 - anything that can detect the condition to which an operational definition refers.

# Validity
 - the extent to which a concrete event defines a property

# Reliability
 - the tendency for an instrument to produce the same measurement whenever it is used to measure the same thing

# Demand Characteristics
* are those aspects of an observational setting that cause people to behave as they think someone else wants or expect

#Naturalistic Observation
* is a technique for gathering scientific information by unobtrusively observing people in their natural environments.
## Ways to achieve this:
* privacy & control
* unawareness

# Observer Bias
* seeing what is expected (expectation can influence observation) (expectation can influence reality)
## ways to prevent this..
* Double-blind - the truth is hidden from both observer and object being observed.

# Confirmation Bias
* the tendency to look for evidences that support one's hypothesis

# Statistic 
* Mode - the value that appears most frequently
* mean - the overall average
* Median - the value in the middle

## Research Strategies
- 5 different strategies are commonly used for hypothesis testing 
### 1. Case Study
   * detailed study of one individual, group, device, event, etc.
   * Advantage: gain ideas, insight
   * Limitation: useless for testing theories, study may not be replicable
### 2. Naturalistic Observation Study  
   * observing/recording behavior in naturally occurring situations, without manipulating/controlling the situation
   * Advantage: 
      * high in ecological validity (shows behavior in the wild)
      * may spark new research
      * may complement experimental/lab research
   * Limitation:
      * used to describe behavior, not for explaining
      * often difficult to obtain a complete description of all variable that influence behavior
   * **Ecological Validity** (*EcoV*): A study has high EcoV if its methods, materials and setting closely approximate the real-world in which a target behavior is being examined.
   * **External Validity** (*ExtV*): A study has high ExtV if its finding generalize to circumstances beyond the research setting
### 3. Survey/Questionnaire Study
   * a method of ascertaining the self-reported attitudes, emotions, preferences, behaviors, habits, etc. of individuals or of groups of individuals
   * Adv: 
      * easy, cheap, quick to obtain large amount of data
      * can be used to learn about any type of issue/question
      * may be high in ecological validity
   * Limitations:
      * wording of questions/items and ordering of questions/items affects results
      * Respondents may not be honest, may 'fake positive'
      * very difficult to obtain a representative sample
### 4. Correlational Study   
   * a systematic assessment of the relationship between two or more variables
   * may involve an examination of existing records   
   * learn about relationship between two or more variables, and make predications from one the the other
   * Advantage:
      easy cheap quick to obtain large amount of data
      can be used address nearly any events
      high in eco validity
   * Limitation : cannot provide info about cause effect links
### 5. Experimental Study
  a research method
