# 2.1 
# Dogmatism
 - peopleâ€™s tendency to cling to assumptions.

# Scientific Method
 * finding facts by using empirical evidence
 * Theory 
   - a hypothetical explanation of a natural phenomenon
   - testable
 * Hypothesis
   - a falsifiable prediction made from a theory
   - must come in pair,H0
   (null hypothesis), H1(alternate hypothesis)
   - Example
     - Does yoga improve the ability to concentrate?

# Empirical Method 
- a set of rules and techniques for observation
Operational definition - which is a description of a property in concrete measurable terms.

# Instrument
 - anything that can detect the condition to which an operational definition refers.

# Validity
 - the extent to which a concrete event defines a property

# Reliability
 - the tendency for an instrument to produce the same measurement whenever it is used to measure the same thing

# Demand Characteristics
* are those aspects of an observational setting that cause people to behave as they think someone else wants or expect

#Naturalistic Observation
* is a technique for gathering scientific information by unobtrusively observing people in their natural environments.
## Ways to achieve this:
* privacy & control
* unawareness

# Observer Bias
* seeing what is expected (expectation can influence observation) (expectation can influence reality)

### Ways to prevent this...
* Double-blind - the truth is hidden from both observer and object being observed.

# Confirmation Bias
* the tendency to look for evidences that support one's hypothesis

# Statistic 
  ## Frequency Distribution
  - a graphic representation of measurements arranged by the number of times each measurement was made

* Mode - the value that appears most frequently
* mean - the overall average
* Median - the value in the middle
* Range - the max measured value - the min measured value
* Standard Deviation - the average difference between a measured data set and its mean


## 9/24 In Class-----------
## Research Strategies
- 5 different strategies are commonly used for hypothesis testing 
### 1. Case Study
   * detailed study of one individual, group, device, event, etc.
   * Advantage: gain ideas, insight
   * Limitation: useless for testing theories, study may not be replicable
### 2. Naturalistic Observation Study  
   * observing/recording behavior in naturally occurring situations, without manipulating/controlling the situation
   * Advantage: 
      * high in ecological validity (shows behavior in the wild)
      * may spark new research
      * may complement experimental/lab research
   * Limitation:
      * used to describe behavior, not for explaining
      * often difficult to obtain a complete description of all variable that influence behavior
   * **Ecological Validity** (*EcoV*): A study has high EcoV if its methods, materials and setting closely approximate the real-world in which a target behavior is being examined.
   * **External Validity** (*ExtV*): A study has high ExtV if its finding generalize to circumstances beyond the research setting

   #difference between the EcoV and ExtV
   Ecological validity allows the study to in settings and situations in which it is exposed to the real world situations, where the studying would naturally occur. External validity is where the results of the study is able to be generalized through the population, environmental and temporal. 
### 3. Survey/Questionnaire Study
   * a method of ascertaining the self-reported attitudes, emotions, preferences, behaviors, habits, etc. of individuals or of groups of individuals
   * Advantage: 
      * easy, cheap, quick to obtain large amount of data
      * can be used to learn about any type of issue/question
      * may be high in ecological validity
   * Limitations:
      * wording of questions/items and ordering of questions/items affects results
      * Respondents may not be honest, may 'fake positive'
      * very difficult to obtain a representative sample
### 4. Correlational Study   
   * a systematic assessment of the relationship between two or more variables
   * may involve an examination of existing records   
   * learn about relationship between two or more variables, and make predications from one the the other
   * Advantage:
      easy cheap quick to obtain large amount of data
      can be used address nearly any events
      high in eco validity
   * Limitation : cannot provide info about cause effect links

  #### Method:
   1. Find variables (properties whose values can vary across individuals or over time)
   2. Make series of measurement
   3. Find pattern of covariation
      - Positive Correlation - more is more or less is less
      - Negative Correlation - less is more of more is less
  #### Third Variable Problem
   - two variable are correlated only because each is causally related to a third variable   
        
  ##### Ways to prevent this:
  - Matched Samples - participants have an identical variable
  - Matched Pairs - participants share a third variable on average
  #### Correlation Coefficient(r)
  if r = 1 => perfect positive correlation
  if r == 0 => no correlation
  if r = -1 => perfect negative correlation

### 5. Experimental Study
  - Manipulation of variable to see how one change(independent variable) as a result of another( dependent variable )
  - control group vs experimental group

  #### Self Selection 
  - a problem when anything about a participant determines whether he or she will be included in the experimental group
  #### Random Assignment 
  - let change decide who will be in control/experiment group
  a research method 


# Variables in Experiments
  - Independent: manipulated by experimenter
  - Dependent: measured in the experiment
  - Control: held constant
  - Noise/nuisance/extraneous: variables that may have a random influence on the DV
  - Confounding: variables that have a systematic/selective influence on the DV eg. the order of an image shown, order of question asked...
    * counterbalancing
    - remove confounding influence by randomizing stimulus order (transform confounding variables into noise variables)
## What is a noise/nuisance variable?
- a variable that has random effects on the result

## What is a confound variable?
- it has different effects on different part of the experiment.

## Internal Validity
- concerns whether an experiment permits us to draw causal conclusion
- threatened by confounding variables
- sample too small or not representative
- demand characteristics
- placebo effect
- experimenter bias

# Measurement Scale
    Measurement is the assignment of numbers or labels to objects or events in a systemic fashion

  ## Four levels of measurement
  1. Nominal
  2. Ordinal
  3. Interval
  4. Ratio  

    Need to know 
      - the measurement principle involved in each scale
      - example for each scale
      - arithmetic operations which are permissible for each scale
      - statistics that are appropriate for
  
  ## Nominal/Naming: 
      People objects or events are grouped as having the same value of some attribute

      - Counting
  ## Ordinal/Ranking:
       People, objects or events with a higher scale value have more of some attribute

       - Counting and Comparisons( < and > )
  ## Interval:
      Intervals between adjacent scale values are equal with respect the attribute being measured

      - Counting/Comparison/Addition/Subtraction
      - Example: IQ score, Personality scale scores

  ## Ratio:
      Same as Interval and there is a rational zero point for the scale

      - Counting/Comparison/Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division
      - Example: Kelvin scale, weight, income in dollars, height, weight       

# Types of Statistics
  ## Descriptive Stat:
      Simple descriptions of what the data show

      Main Types of Descriptors
          - Type or shapes of the distribution
          - The central tendency of the distribution (mean median and mode)
          - The dispersion of the distribution (spread of value in a distribution)   

## The Normal Distribution
 - Symmetrical   
 - Mean/Median/Mode in the middle

## Bi/MultiModal Distribution
 - Multiple peak
  
## Skewed Distribution
  - Skewed to left (negative)
  - Skewed to right (positive)

### Ceiling Effect:
    When scores are bunched up against the top of the scale

    People with potential to reach higher scale are cut off by the maximum

### Floor Effect:
    When scores are bunched up against the bottom of the scale

### Measure Of Central Tendency
- Mean

$$ Mean = \sum \frac{x}{n} $$ 

- Median:The exact middle of a set of values   

- Mode :The value that occurs most frequently in a set of data
    
## Inferential Stat: 
      A collection of procedures for making decisions about hypothesis

## Measures of Dispersion
Range - highest minus the lowest value in a set of values

Standard Deviation

 $$ SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x - mean)^2}}{n-1}}$$

- Do not compare graphs that does not have the same scale
- Goal of research is to determine whether experimental group is difference between two distributions is due to chance (H0) or due to the IV (H1)
- if the distribution graphs for control group and experimental group overlaps, then some of the result can be due to chance
- ways to reduce overlaps:
    - manipulate the IV more
    - reduce noise variables

## Working with Data
1. What is the scale?
2. Shape of the distribution
3. Height of the distribution

- two peaks ex: sex, etc...

## Correlation
- identify the linear relationship between two variables

### Correlation Coefficient

$$ -1 <= CC <= 1 $$

- CC = 0 -> no indicates no relation ship
- CC > 0 -> positive correlation
- CC < 0 -> negative correlation
- The absolute value of CC tells us the strength of the correlation

### Non Linear Relationships
- zero correlation can mean the relationship is not linear
 
### Research Ethics
- all research with humans or animals must undergo an ethics review
