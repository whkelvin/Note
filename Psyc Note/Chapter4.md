### Sensation 
- Stimulation of sense organ
- the processing/activity resulting from the simulation of a sense organ

### Perception 
- The organization, identification, and interpretation of a sensation
- use sensory input and existing knowledge to construct an interpretation of inputs
- top-down: analysis/ processing that is guided by concepts, expectations, context, by existing knowledge
- interactive (bottom-up): analysis/processing that is guided by both data from the environment and existing knowledge&concepts

### Transduction 
- When sensors in the body convert physical signal to neural signals and send them to the CNS
- the process o converting physical energy into neural signals

### Psychophysics
- The study of how physical stimuli, the sensations associated with them, are translated into psychological experiences
- Method that measure someone's sensitivity to strength of the stimulus

### Absolute Threshold
- The minimal intensity needed to just barely detect a stimulus in 50% of the trials

### Just Noticeable Difference 
- Minimal change in a stimulus that can just barely be detected (I am hungry cry and I am dying cry)

### Weber's Law
- The just noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion despite variations in intensity

- as a percentage increase instead of increase by interval values
- dR = ?% * R

### Signal Detection Theory
- The response to a stimulus depends both on a person's sensitivity to the stimulus in the presence o noise and on a person's decision criterion

- assumes that the detection of signals involves decision processes

- hit, correct negative, miss, false alarm


#### Decision Criterion
- how much evidence we need for yes/no responses?
    - strength of signal
    - sensitivity of system
#### Decision Biases
- what factors change (raise/lower) the decision criterion?
    - cost/consequences of wrong decision
    - expectations/preference

### Waves
#### Wavelength (Hue)
- wavelength is the distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of another wave
- color of light

#### Intensity 
- amplitude of the wave
- brightness of light

### Sensory Adaptation 
- Sensitivity of to prolonged stimulation tends to decline over time as an organism adapts to current condition

### Visual Acuity
- The ability to see fine detail

## The Eye
### Path of light into the eye
1. Cornea: bend lights through pupil (laser surgery reshape this part not the lens)
2. Pupil: a hole for light to pass through
3. Iris: the colored part that controls the amount of light to pass through 
4. Retina: a layer of light sensitive tissue

### Accommodation
- The Process by which the eye maintains a clear image on the retina (focus)

### Light Detecting Cells (Photoreceptor)
- Cones: detects color
- Rods: sensitive at low-light 

### Fovea
- a cone cells dense area
- explain why peripheral vision is not good

### Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC)
- bundled RGC axons form the optic nerve

### Path of Signal
1. from cones and rods to Optic nerve
2. Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) in thalamus
3. Occipital Lobe 
4. Visual Cortex (area v1)

### Color Fatigue
- Color Afterimage

### Color Opponent System
- pairs of visual neurons work in opposition

### Two Visual Stream
1. ventral: the what pathway
2. dorsal: the where or how pathway

    - Visual Form Agnosia: inability to recognize objects by sight(damage in the what pathway)

### Parallel Processing
- brain's capacity to perform many activities at the same time

### Binding Problem 
- how the brain links features together so that we see unified objects rather than free-floating or miscombined features

### Illusory Conjunction
-  a perceptual mistake whereby the brain combines features from multiple objects

### Feature Integration Theory
- attention is not required to detect individual features that make up the stimulus; it is required to combine the features together

### Perceptual Constancy
- even as aspects of sensory signals change, perception remains consistent

### Principle of Perception
- Simplicity
- Closure
- Continuity
- Similarity
- Proximity
- Common Fate

### Theory of Object Recognition
- Template: an object you have seen before
- Parts based object: objects are stored in memory as a structural description

### Change Blindness
- People fail to detect the changes to the visual details of a scene

### Inattentional Blindness
- a failure to to perceive objects that are not the focus of attention

### The Ear
1. Pinna - the outside "radar" shaped structure that gathers sound
2. Auditory Canal
3. Eardrum - vibrate according to sound wave
4. Ossicles - small bones that amplify the sound
5. Semicircular Canal 
6. Cochlea - for auditory transduction
7. Basilar Membrane - a structure in inner ear that vibrate along with the fluid in cochlea and move the hair cells to produce a neural signal
8. to thalamus then cerebral cortex - Area A1

### Perceiving Pitch
- Place Code - different frequencies stimulate neural signals at specific places along the basilar membrane (high frequency)
- Temporal code - low frequency

### Hearing Loss
- Sensory Neural Hearing - damage to cochlea
- mechanical problem - damage to eardrum or ossicles

### Haptic Perception
- Active exploration of the environment with our hands
