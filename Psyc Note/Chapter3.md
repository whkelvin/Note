## Neurons
        Cells in the nervous system that communicate with one another to perform information processing tasks

### Glial Cells:
- support cells in the nervous system
- myelinization

### Types of Neurons
- Sensory neurons
    - receive information from the external world and convey this info to the spinal cord and the brain

# Neurotransmitters and Drugs
## Acetylcholine (Ach)
- excitatory neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions - avtivating voluntary muscle action

- neuromodulator on plasticity, arousal and reward, enhances sensory perceptions when we wake up

-lack of ACH - Alzheimer's desease
-long term memory (inability to learn new stuff)

## Glutamate 
- most common (90% of synapses)
- relaying sensory information and for learning
- memory storage
- long term memory

## GABA
- inhibitory (found in 90% of synapses)
- Regulates neuronal excitability 
- Relax muscle

## Dopamine
- feelings of enjoyment and reinforcement
- motivation
cognition, voluntary movement, motivation, punishment, reward, sleep, mood, attention, working memory, learning
- is released by rewarding experience: food, sex, drugs, and neutral stimuli that become associated with them
- low dopamine -> attention deficit disorder
- depletions of dopamine -> Parkinson's disease
- high -> Schizophrenia

## Serotonin
- well being -> homeostasis - appetite, sleep, temperature, mood, muscle contractin, and function of the cardiovascular system and endocrine system
- low level -> depression

# Drug Functions
- works by increasing effect of, interfering with or mimicking neurotransmitters

## Agnostic
- drugs that mimic/ increase the action of a neuroransmittes
## Antagonists
- drugs that block the function of a neurotransmitter
## Reuptake Inhibitors:
- Propranolol

# Nervous System
- Peripheral and Central
- peripheral can be atomatic or somatic
- atomatic can be sympathetic or parasympathetic
