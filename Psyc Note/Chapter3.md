## Neurons
- Cells in the nervous system that communicate with one another to perform information processing tasks
- Composed of Cell body, dendrite, and axon

### Dendrite
- receive information from other neurons and relay it to the cell body

### Axon
- carry information to other neurons

### Glial Cells:
- support cells in the nervous system
- myelinization

## Myelin Sheath
- an insulating layer of fatty material

## Synapse
- gap in between dendrite of one cell to the axon or cell body of another cell

### Types of Neurons
#### Sensory neurons
- receive information from the external world and convey this info to the spinal cord and the brain
#### Motor Neurons
- Carry signals from the spinal cord to the muscles to produce movement

#### Interneuron
- connect sensory neurons, motor neurons, or other interneurons

# Electrochemical Actions of Neurons
## Conduction
- the movement of an electric signal within neurons
## Transmission 
- movement of electric signals from one neuron to another

## Resting Potential 
- the potential difference between the inside and outside of a neuron
- negatively charged inside (K+ and A- <protein>), positively charged outside (Na+ and Cl-)
- pump push Na out and pull K in
- -70 mV

## Action Potential
- an electric signal that is carried along the length of a neuron's axon to a synapse
- all or none (threshold)
- Na+ channel is opened, Na+ flow into the cell (-70 mV -> 40 mV)

## Refractory Period
- the time following an action potential during which a new action potential can not be initiated
- Na+ gate closes
- K+ gate open, K+ out the cell, cell potential decreases 
- Back to resting potential

## Myelin Sheath
- nodes of Ranvier - break points between lumps of myelin sheath to increase conduction speed
- The jumping of charges between nodes is called saltatory conduction

## Axon
- ends in knob like structure called terminal buttons
- terminal buttons are full of neurotransmitter

## Dendrite
- contains receptors for neural transmitter

## Synaptic Transmission
- neural transmission from presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic neuron

## Reuptake
- neural transmitters are reabsorbed by the terminal buttons

## Enzyme Deactivation
- specific enzymes breaks down neural transmitter

## Auto-receptor
- detects the concentration of neural transmitters and determine whether or not to release more 


# Neurotransmitters and Drugs
## Acetylcholine (Ach)
- excitatory neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions - activating voluntary muscle action
 
- contributes to the regulation of attention, learning, memory, dreaming and sleeping 

- neuromodulator on plasticity, arousal and reward, enhances sensory perceptions when we wake up

- lack of ACH - Alzheimer's disease (severe memory impairments)

- long term memory (inability to learn new stuff)

## Glutamate 
- enhance neurotransmission
- most common (90% of synapses)
- relaying sensory information and for learning
- memory storage
- long term memory

## GABA
- reduce neurotransmission
- inhibitory (found in 90% of synapses)
- Regulates neuronal excitability 
- Relax muscle

## Dopamine
- feelings of enjoyment and reinforcement

- motivation, cognition, voluntary movement, motivation, punishment, reward, sleep, mood, attention, working memory, learning

- is released by rewarding experience: food, sex, drugs, and neutral stimuli that become associated with them

- low dopamine -> attention deficit disorder

- depletions of dopamine -> Parkinson's disease (severe shaking)

- high -> Schizophrenia (hallucination)

## Serotonin
- well being -> homeostasis - appetite, sleep, temperature, mood, muscle contraction, and function of the cardiovascular system and endocrine system
- aggressive behavior
- low level -> depression

## Norepinephrine
- states of vigilance
- highlight awareness of dangers in the environment

## Endorphins 
- act at pain path and emotion centers of the brain
- "morphine"
- Runner's High

# Drug Functions
- works by increasing effect of, interfering with or mimicking neurotransmitters

## Agnostic
- drugs that mimic/ increase the action of a neurotransmitters

- Amphetamine - stimulates the release of norepinephrine and dopamine

- Prozac - block reuptake of serotonin to treat depression

## Antagonists
- drugs that block the function of a neurotransmitters

## Reuptake Inhibitors:
- Propranolol - reduce heart rate

# Nervous System
- Peripheral (connects the CNS with the rest of the body) and Central (brain and spinal cord)
- peripheral can be automatic(involuntary part of the body) or somatic(voluntary)
- automatic can be sympathetic(prepare the body for challenging situation) or parasympathetic (relax the body)

## Spinal Reflex
- simple pathways in the nervous system that rapidly generate muscle contractions (no brainer)

# The Brain
## HindBrain
- coordinates information coming into and out of the spinal cord

### Medulla
- coordinates heart rate, circulation, and respiration

### Reticular Formation
- sleep, wakefulness and levels of arousal

### Cerebellum
- controls fine motor skills (balance)

### Pons
- relays information from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain

## MidBrain
### Tectum
- orients an organism in the environment

### Tegmentum
- movement and arousal
- orient an organism towards sensory stimuli

## Forebrain
### Cerebral Cortex
- outer layer of the brain
- divided into two hemisphere
- most complex
- Gyri: smooth surfaces of the cortex
- Sulci - indentation of the cortex (ç¸«)

### Subcortical Structures
- under the cerebral cortex near the center of the brain

#### Thalamus
- relays and filters information from the senses and transmits the information to the cerebral cortex

#### Hypothalamus
- regulate body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sexual behavior
- send info to pituitary gland to start secretion (ask for oxytocin for milk secretion)

#### Hippocampus
- creating new memories and integrating them into a network of knowledge

#### Amygdala (almond shaped)
- emotional memory 

#### Basal Ganglia
- direct intentional  movement

#### Pituitary Gland
- master gland of the body's hormone producing system
- release hormones that direct the functions of many other glands

#### Hemisphere
- Left
    - logical
    - sequential
    - rational
    - analytical
    - objective
    - look at parts
- Corpus Callosum: connects the two hemisphere and handles communication across the hemisphere
- Right
    - Random
    - intuitive
    - holistic
    - synthesizing
    - subjective
    - looks at wholes

#### Lobes
##### Frontal Lobe
- movement, abstract thinking, planning, memory, and judgement

##### Parietal Lobe
- touch information
- somatosensory cortex

##### Occipital Lobe
- visual information
- occipital cortex (area v1)

#### Temporal Lobe
- hearing and language
- primary auditory cortex

### Association Areas
- composed of neurons that help provide sense and meaning to information registered in the cortex

### Mirror Neurons
- active when an animal performs a behavior, and when an animal watches other animals perform the same task

### Broca's Area
- in left frontal lobe, language generation

### Wernicke's Area
- in upper left temporal lobe, language comprehension

### Methods for Revealing Brain Behavior Links

#### CT Scan (Computerized axial tomography scan)
- takes a series of x ray photos
- does not show functions of brain

#### MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- uses a strong magnetic field to line up the nuclei of specific molecules in the brain tissue
- higher resolution than CT scan

##### Diffusion Tensor Imaging 
- track movement of white matter diffusion

#### PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography)
- radio active substance is injected into blood stream, the part require greater blood flow lights up

#### fMRI (functional MRI)
- detects the difference between oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin 
- specific parts light up 

#### TMS
- uses magnetic field in order to temporarily enhance or depress activity in a specific area of the brain

#### EEG & ERP (Event Related Potentials)
- electroencephalogram
