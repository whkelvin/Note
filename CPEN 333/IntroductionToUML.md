# The Software Life Cycle
- the waterfall model (traditional software engineering)
- system engineering -> analysis -> design -> code -> testing -> maintenance -> back to each step and repeat
- one delivery

## System Engineering
- what operating systems?
- hardware
- what programming language to use? 

## Analysis
- architectural analysis (UML model)

## Agile Development
- frequent updates of software and releases
- repeating of the waterfall model

## UML (Unified Modelling Language)
- used to communicate high level program structure
- has syntax and semantics
- 13 diagrams : 7 are important, 3 are always used
- architecture
- does not work for small project

## Use Case Diagram
- users of system
- how different customers interact with the system

## Class Diagram
- static structure of the software
