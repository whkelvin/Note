# The Software Life Cycle
- the waterfall model (traditional software engineering)
- system engineering -> analysis -> design -> code -> testing -> maintenance -> back to each step and repeat
- one delivery

## System Engineering
- what operating systems?
- hardware
- what programming language to use? 

## Analysis
- architectural analysis (UML model)

## Agile Development
- frequent updates of software and releases
- repeating of the waterfall model

## UML (Unified Modelling Language)
- used to communicate high level program structure
- has syntax and semantics
- 13 diagrams : 7 are important, 3 are always used
- architecture
- does not work for small project

## Use Case Diagram
- users of system
- how different customers interact with the system

## Class Diagram
- static structure of the software



# User Stories and UML Use Case Diagrams
- 3 things required for a use case
1. interaction of "USER" and system (the user must take part in it)
2. benefits for user (reason for user to use this case)
3. effects on system

## Relationships
- includes (when several use cases rely on one use case)
- extends (optional use case: scenarios when primary use case fails)

# UML procedures
1. create a user
2. list use cases
3. list steps for the use cases
4. list the scenarios that could happen from each step for the use cases
